# Pipefy clone

This project is a simple side project implemented to put into practice concepts of the React Drag and Drop library - [React DnD](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about). The output is a simple Kanban where the cards can be dragged and dropped onto another list or even over another card, overwriting the list original order.
